Today, I read this article that title is “Lobe’s ridiculously simple machine learning platform aims to empower non-technical creators”. Lobe, a startup and platform that aims to empower non-technical creators\cite{lobe2018}. It is based on machine learning, and you can design something you need in your field that you isn’t a professional programming designer and engineer. It will make everyone use AI model as simple to put together as LEGO bricks.



In this paper, designer compared the situation the early days of PCs, when computer scientists and engineers were the only ones who knew how to operate them. And at present, most of people can grasp the usable kills of computer. Designer want this platform to openness and sharing for everyone. As demonstrated in a video tour of the platform, users can make an app that recognizes hand gestures and matches them to emoji without ever seeing a line of code, let alone writing one\cite{lobe2018}. As shown in the Figure \ref{1}.

People have different needs in the different fields. That’s why designers created Lobe, to give more people from diverse backgrounds and disciplines the ability to invent with deep learning and enable the next wave of intelligent products and experiences. This platform is able to take people different experience with the AI technology, and can make people realize the progress of science and technology. And AI can apply to our daily life.
