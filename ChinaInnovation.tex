\title{China is becoming a global leader in innovation}




\begin{document}

\maketitle


Today, I read this article about the situation of Chinese innovation in the word. With the development of the age, competition between countries is more and more intensifying. In the past time, Chinese technologies was not advanced, and China mainly depended on importing products from other countries, or relied on technical assistance from other countries. If other countries refused to offer a helping hand, certain project would not continue to go ahead.



From then on, China was no longer content with development by following other countries, but through independent innovation. From example, China has developed own high-speed railways by the efforts of Chinese’s people. There is following the figure \ref{1}. Because of the large land of China, China has widely complex climatic and geological conditions in different areas. High- speed railways need to fit changing temperatures and run normally against extremely strong wind\cite{ChinaInnovation}. Fortunately, after lots of efforts, China has made it through innovation.

At present, China has blessed with many technologies lead the word in some fields. I believe that China will have many new innovations in the future. And this innovations will service for Chinese people and each person of the world. I’m looking forward to the coming of this time.
