  The OpenLab Paris, the second such platform of Huawei in Europe following that in Germany, will " support competitiveness of French companies" by improving expertise in retail, smart city, connected car and internet fields. The OpenLab is a platform for cooperation between technology partners for the development of new products and solutions that meet the needs submitted by customers.



  In my view, HUAWEI's OpenLab established in Germany and France is the manifestation of China's science and technology going abroad. It represents the progress and rise of China's technology. Secondly, OpenLab is not only a laboratory, but also the "HUAWEI + partner" program hatching, joint verification, to enhance the competitiveness of products, enhance customer value and satisfaction platform. Through OpenLab, HUAWEI and partners work together to build solutions in the fields of manufacturing, finance, energy and electricity, transportation, smart cities, and the Internet of things. As a new word, OpenLab is integrating into the city, and makes the city more full of technology sense through thousands of people.
