Robots start to replace people to work. And in the next time, factories can realize “the black lamp factories”. Because of this, at the first time, this article gives a worry . Each robot displaced 3.6 jobs in the UK.\upcite{robots} Following figure 1, robots are working. Robots primarily constitute substitutes for humans, but they do not create jobs, so far. In contrast, using robots can make someone lose their jobs. And it is a huge threat to people’s job. However, this worry may be far too pessimistic in the later of this paper. There is, so far, little evidence that robots are putting humans out of work across the economy as a whole.



In my view, although robots displace the work of people, we cannot think about problems in certain aspect. We should think out problems in a whole. On the one hand, this is a signal the development of age. Robots can do some work that people don’t achieve or have difficulties. And they can help people solve difficult questions. On the other hand, other industries can provide the chance of employment to people. This can achieve a balance. People change their work. Robots can bring the benefits to people.
