\title{Deep Learning is Large Neural Networks}




\begin{document}


\maketitle


Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks.



The idea of deep learning will make learning algorithms much better and easier to use and make revolutionary advances in machine learning and AI according to Andrew Ng°Øs talk in 2013. And he is from Coursera and Chief Scientist at Baidu Research. When we enter into the big data times, the methods of dealing with big data is developing prosperously. There are many algorithms in this filed. Because of the amount of data is very large, we need to a method or algorithm that processing large data in a short time as soon as possible. The core of deep learning is that we now have fast enough computers and enough data to actually train large neural networks. Other machine learning techniques can reach a plateau in performance. In contrast, deep learning is difference, and its performance continues to increase when we construct larger neural networks and train them with more and more data. This is the advantage and values of deep learning.

The chief value of deep learning is through supervised learning or learning from labeled data. This is one reason that deep learning has taken off like crazy. Deep learning is really all about large neural networks. And deep learning is applied to AI, and people can make °∞black technologies°± more and more.
